            We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks. Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D understanding in streaming environments.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone Repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NIRVANALAN/STream3R
    cd STream3R
    ```

2. Create Conda Environment 
    ```bash
    conda create -n stream3r python=3.11 cmake=3.14.0 -y
    conda activate stream3r
    ```
3. Install Python Dependencies

    **Important:** Install [Torch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) based on your CUDA version. For example, for *Torch 2.8.0 + CUDA 12.6*:

    ```
    # Install Torch
    pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

    # Install other dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Install STream3R as a package
    pip install -e .
    ```

## :computer: Inference

You can now try STream3R with the following code. The checkpoint will be downloaded automatically from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/yslan/STream3R). 

You can set the inference mode to `causal` for causal attention, `window` for sliding window attention (with a default window size of 5), or `full` for bidirectional attention.

```python
import os
import torch
from stream3r.models.stream3r import STream3R
from stream3r.models.components.utils.load_fn import load_and_preprocess_images

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

model = STream3R.from_pretrained("yslan/STream3R").to(device)
model.eval()

example_dir = "examples/static_room"
image_names = [os.path.join(example_dir, file) for file in sorted(os.listdir(example_dir))]
images = load_and_preprocess_images(image_names).to(device)

with torch.no_grad():
    # Use one mode "causal", "window", or "full" in a single forward pass
    predictions = model(images, mode="causal")
``` 

A script is already at [inference_stream3r.py](inference_stream3r.py).

We also support a KV cache version to enable streaming input using `StreamSession`. The `StreamSession` takes sequential input and processes them one by one, making it suitable for real-time or low-latency applications. This streaming 3D reconstruction pipeline can be applied in various scenarios such as real-time robotics, autonomous navigation, online 3D understanding and SLAM. An example usage is shown below:

```python
import os
import torch
from stream3r.models.stream3r import STream3R
from stream3r.stream_session import StreamSession
from stream3r.models.components.utils.load_fn import load_and_preprocess_images

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

model = STream3R.from_pretrained("yslan/STream3R").to(device)

example_dir = "examples/static_room"
image_names = [os.path.join(example_dir, file) for file in sorted(os.listdir(example_dir))]
images = load_and_preprocess_images(image_names).to(device)
# StreamSession supports KV cache management for both "causal" and "window" modes.
session = StreamSession(model, mode="causal")

with torch.no_grad():
    # Process images one by one to simulate streaming inference
    for i in range(images.shape[0]):
        image = images[i : i + 1]
        predictions = session.forward_stream(image)
    session.clear()
``` 

## :zap: Demo
You can run the demo built on [VGG-T's code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt) using the script [`app.py`](app.py) with the following command:

```sh
python app.py
```

## :hotsprings: Training

1. Prepare Dataset

    We follow [CUT3R](https://github.com/CUT3R/CUT3R/blob/main/docs/preprocess.md) to preprocess the dataset for training.

2. Set Up Config

    Update training config file ```configs/experiment/stream3r/stream3r.yaml``` as needed. For example:
    - Set `pretrained` to the path of the [VGG-T checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/facebook/VGGT-1B/resolve/main/model.pt).
    - Set `data_root` to the directory where you saved the processed dataset. 

3. Launch training with:
    ```bash
    python stream3r/train.py experiment=stream3r/stream3r
    ```

4. After training, you can convert the checkpoint into a `state_dict` file, for example:
   <details> <summary>Click to view code for checkpoint conversion</summary>
   
    ```python
    from lightning.pytorch.utilities.deepspeed import convert_zero_checkpoint_to_fp32_state_dict

    convert_zero_checkpoint_to_fp32_state_dict(
        checkpoint_dir="logs/stream3r/runs/stream3r_99999/checkpoints/000-00002000.ckpt",
        output_file="logs/stream3r/runs/stream3r_99999/checkpoints/last_aggregated.ckpt",
        tag=None
    )

    # Convert `.ckpt` to `.safetensors` for demo.py
    def convert_ckpt_to_safetensors(ckpt_path, output_path):
        print(f"Loading checkpoint from {ckpt_path}")
        ckpt = torch.load(ckpt_path, map_location="cpu", weights_only=False)
        
        if "state_dict" in ckpt:
            state_dict = ckpt["state_dict"]
        else:
            state_dict = ckpt
        
        print("Converting state dict...")
        converted_state_dict = {}
        for k, v in state_dict.items():
            if k.startswith("net."):
                k = k[4:]  # Remove "net." prefix
            converted_state_dict[k] = v.contiguous()
       
        print(f"Saving to {output_path}")
        save_file(converted_state_dict, output_path)
        print("Done!")

    convert_ckpt_to_safetensors("logs/stream3r/runs/stream3r_99999/checkpoints/last_aggregated.ckpt", "model.safetensors"
    ```

## 📈 Evaluation

The evaluation follows [MonST3R](https://github.com/Junyi42/monst3r) and [Spann3R](https://github.com/HengyiWang/spann3r), [CUT3R](https://github.com/CUT3R/CUT3R).

1. Prepare Evaluation Dataset

    We follow the dataset preparation guides from [MonST3R](https://github.com/Junyi42/monst3r/blob/main/data/evaluation_script.md) and [Spann3R](https://github.com/HengyiWang/spann3r/blob/main/docs/data_preprocess.md) to prepare the datasets. For convenience, we provide the processed datasets on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yslan/pointmap_regression_evalsets), which can be downloaded directly.

    The datasets should be organized as follows under the root directiory of the project:
    ```
    data/
    ├── 7scenes
    ├── bonn
    ├── kitti
    ├── neural_rgbd
    ├── nyu-v2
    ├── scannetv2
    ├── sintel
    └── tum
    ```

2. Run Evaluation

    Use the provided scripts to evaluate different tasks.

    *For Video Depth and Camera Pose Estimation, some datasets contain more than 100 images. To reduce memory usage, we use `StreamSession` to process frames sequentially while managing the KV cache.*

    ```bash
    bash eval/video_depth/run.sh
    ```
    Results will be saved in `eval_results/video_depth/${model_name}/${data}/result_scale.json`.

    bash eval/relpose/run.sh
    ```
    Results will be saved in `eval_results/relpose/${model_name}/${data}/_error_log.txt`.

    ```bash
    bash eval/mv_recon/run.sh
    ```
    Results will be saved in `eval_results/mv_recon/${model_name}/${data}/logs_all.txt`.


## :calendar: TODO

- [x] Release evaluation code.
